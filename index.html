                <h2>Definição de Tecnologia:</h2>
                <img src="assets/Tech.jpeg">
                <p class="p1">A tecnologia pode ser definida em dois sentidos: um mais amplo e outro mais restrito. Na
                    aplicação
                    mais genérica do termo, pode-se considerar qualquer inovação utilitária para o ser humano como uma
                    tecnologia. Já em um sentido mais restrito, seria o vínculo com o desenvolvimento de soluções
                    avançadas para facilitar a execução de tarefas rotineiras. No sentido amplo, dá para dizer que o
                    macaco de 2001: Uma Odisséia no Espaço que usou um osso para agredir os outros usou uma tecnologia
                    autoral. A funcionalidade dada a uma parte do corpo de um ser morto permitiu que aquele animal
                    tivesse algum destaque na busca pelo seu objetivo.<br>

                </p>

                <p class="p2"> Já no sentido mais restrito, falar de tecnologia é o coração do Canaltech:os novos
                    dispositivos, as
                    inteligências artificiais, os avanços científicos, a exploração espacial e a criação de objetos ou
                    serviços pautados na otimização da rotina das pessoas.<br>
                    Ambos os exemplos citados têm em comum a aquisição do conhecimento prévio e a sua
                    aplicação, com base
                    em alguma metodologia intelectual, na resolução de problemas. Para se ter uma tecnologia empregada,
                    é necessário existir a consciência de querer usá-la com algum propósito. <br>
                    Na atualidade, a palavra
                    tecnologia é usada para designar aparelhos modernos, como notebooks, celulares e eletrônicos, e em
                    basicamente tudo ligado ao ambiente digital. Estão inclusos no rol tecnológico praticamente tudo que
                    envolve a internet, a engenharia, a biologia, a medicina, o espaço e seus derivados.<br>

                    Tecnologia (do grego "τέχνη": "técnica, arte, ofício" e "-λογία": "estudo") é o conjunto de
                    processos e habilidades usados na produção de bens ou serviços, ou na realização de objetivos, como
                    em investigações científicas. Isso também pode ser embutido em máquinas para permitir a operação
                    destas sem conhecimento detalhado do funcionamento. Sistema tecnológico (ou computacional) que
                    através do input de dados, faz à análise destes e, então produz um resultado.<br>

                    Entre os efeitos da tecnologia estão o desenvolvimento de economias mais avançadas (incluindo a
                    atual globalização econômica) e o aparecimento dos bens de Veblen. Muitos processos tecnológicos
                    produzem produtos indesejados, conhecidos como poluição, e consomem recursos naturais não renováveis
                    que afetam o meio ambiente da Terra. Inovações sempre influenciaram os valores de uma sociedade e
                    levantaram novas questões na ética da tecnologia. Exemplos incluem o aparecimento da noção de
                    eficiência em termos de produtividade humana e os desafios da bioética.<br>

                    O uso da tecnologia também provoca debates filosóficos onde se discute se a tecnologia melhora a
                    condição humana ou a piora. O Neoludismo, Anarco-primitivismo e outros movimentos reacionários
                    similares criticam a difusão da tecnologia, argumentando que ela prejudica o meio ambiente e aliena
                    pessoas. Já os proponentes de ideologias como o Transumanismo e o Tecnoprogressivismo enxergam o
                    progresso tecnológico contínuo como benéfico para a sociedade e para a condição humana.

            <article  class="parallax2">
                <p class="p2"> Technologies are becoming increasingly complicated and increasingly interconnected. Cars,
                    airplanes, medical devices, financial transactions, and electricity systems all rely on more
                    computer software than they ever have before, making them seem both harder to understand and, in
                    some cases, harder to control. Government and corporate surveillance of individuals and information
                    processing relies largely on digital technologies and artificial intelligence, and therefore
                    involves less human-to-human contact than ever before and more opportunities for biases to be
                    embedded and codified in our technological systems in ways we may not even be able to identify or
                    recognize. Bioengineering advances are opening up new terrain for challenging philosophical,
                    political, and economic questions regarding human-natural relations. Additionally, the management of
                    these large and small devices and systems is increasingly done through the cloud, so that control
                    over them is both very remote and removed from direct human or social control. The study of how to
                    make technologies like artificial intelligence or the Internet of Things “explainable” has become
                    its own area of research because it is so difficult to understand how they work or what is at fault
                    when something goes wrong (Gunning and Aha 2019).<br>

                    This growing complexity makes it more difficult than ever—and more imperative than ever—for scholars
                    to probe how technological advancements are altering life around the world in both positive and
                    negative ways and what social, political, and legal tools are needed to help shape the development
                    and design of technology in beneficial directions. This can seem like an impossible task in light of
                    the rapid pace of technological change and the sense that its continued advancement is inevitable,
                    but many countries around the world are only just beginning to take significant steps toward
                    regulating computer technologies and are still in the process of radically rethinking the rules
                    governing global data flows and exchange of technology across borders.<br>

                    These are exciting times not just for technological development but also for technology policy—our
                    technologies may be more advanced and complicated than ever but so, too, are our understandings of
                    how they can best be leveraged, protected, and even constrained. The structures of technological
                    systems as determined largely by government and institutional policies and those structures have
                    tremendous implications for social organization and agency, ranging from open source, open systems
                    that are highly distributed and decentralized, to those that are tightly controlled and closed,
                    structured according to stricter and more hierarchical models. And just as our understanding of the
                    governance of technology is developing in new and interesting ways, so, too, is our understanding of
                    the social, cultural, environmental, and political dimensions of emerging technologies. We are
                    realizing both the challenges and the importance of mapping out the full range of ways that
                    technology is changing our society, what we want those changes to look like, and what tools we have
                    to try to influence and guide those shifts.<br>

            <article  class="parallax">
                <p class="p2"> Technology can be a source of tremendous optimism. It can help overcome some of the
                    greatest challenges our society faces, including climate change, famine, and disease. For those who
                    believe in the power of innovation and the promise of creative destruction to advance economic
                    development and lead to better quality of life, technology is a vital economic driver (Schumpeter
                    1942). But it can also be a tool of tremendous fear and oppression, embedding biases in automated
                    decision-making processes and information-processing algorithms, exacerbating economic and social
                    inequalities within and between countries to a staggering degree, or creating new weapons and
                    avenues for attack unlike any we have had to face in the past. Scholars have even contended that the
                    emergence of the term technology in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries marked a shift from
                    viewing individual pieces of machinery as a means to achieving political and social progress to the
                    more dangerous, or hazardous, view that larger-scale, more complex technological systems were a
                    semiautonomous form of progress in and of themselves (Marx 2010). More recently, technologists have
                    sharply criticized what they view as a wave of new Luddites, people intent on slowing the
                    development of technology and turning back the clock on innovation as a means of mitigating the
                    societal impacts of technological change (Marlowe 1970).<br>

                    At the heart of fights over new technologies and their resulting global changes are often two
                    conflicting visions of technology: a fundamentally optimistic one that believes humans use it as a
                    tool to achieve greater goals, and a fundamentally pessimistic one that holds that technological
                    systems have reached a point beyond our control. Technology philosophers have argued that neither of
                    these views is wholly accurate and that a purely optimistic or pessimistic view of technology is
                    insufficient to capture the nuances and complexity of our relationship to technology (Oberdiek and
                    Tiles 1995). Understanding technology and how we can make better decisions about designing,
                    deploying, and refining it requires capturing that nuance and complexity through in-depth analysis
                    of the impacts of different technological advancements and the ways they have played out in all
                    their complicated and controversial messiness across the world.<br>

                    These impacts are often unpredictable as technologies are adopted in new contexts and come to be
                    used in ways that sometimes diverge significantly from the use cases envisioned by their designers.
                    The internet, designed to help transmit information between computer networks, became a crucial
                    vehicle for commerce, introducing unexpected avenues for crime and financial fraud. Social media
                    platforms like Facebook and Twitter, designed to connect friends and families through sharing
                    photographs and life updates, became focal points of election controversies and political influence.
                    Cryptocurrencies, originally intended as a means of decentralized digital cash, have become a
                    significant environmental hazard as more and more computing resources are devoted to mining these
                    forms of virtual money. One of the crucial challenges in this area is therefore recognizing,
                    documenting, and even anticipating some of these unexpected consequences and providing mechanisms to
                    technologists for how to think through the impacts of their work, as well as possible other paths to
                    different outcomes (Verbeek 2006). And just as technological innovations can cause unexpected harm,
                    they can also bring about extraordinary benefits—new vaccines and medicines to address global
                    pandemics and save thousands of lives, new sources of energy that can drastically reduce emissions
                    and help combat climate change, new modes of education that can reach people who would otherwise
                    have no access to schooling. Regulating technology therefore requires a careful balance of
                    mitigating risks without overly restricting potentially beneficial innovations.<br>

            <article  class="parallax2">
                <p class="p2"> Nations around the world have taken very different approaches to governing emerging
                    technologies and have adopted a range of different technologies themselves in pursuit of more modern
                    governance structures and processes (Braman 2009). In Europe, the precautionary principle has guided
                    much more anticipatory regulation aimed at addressing the risks presented by technologies even
                    before they are fully realized. For instance, the European Union’s General Data Protection
                    Regulation focuses on the responsibilities of data controllers and processors to provide individuals
                    with access to their data and information about how that data is being used not just as a means of
                    addressing existing security and privacy threats, such as data breaches, but also to protect against
                    future developments and uses of that data for artificial intelligence and automated decision-making
                    purposes. In Germany, Technische Überwachungsvereine, or TÜVs, perform regular tests and inspections
                    of technological systems to assess and minimize risks over time, as the tech landscape evolves. In
                    the United States, by contrast, there is much greater reliance on litigation and liability regimes
                    to address safety and security failings after-the-fact. These different approaches reflect not just
                    the different legal and regulatory mechanisms and philosophies of different nations but also the
                    different ways those nations prioritize rapid development of the technology industry versus safety,
                    security, and individual control. Typically, governance innovations move much more slowly than
                    technological innovations, and regulations can lag years, or even decades, behind the technologies
                    they aim to govern.<br>

                    In addition to this varied set of national regulatory approaches, a variety of international and
                    nongovernmental organizations also contribute to the process of developing standards, rules, and
                    norms for new technologies, including the International Organization for Standardization­ and the
                    International Telecommunication Union. These multilateral and NGO actors play an especially
                    important role in trying to define appropriate boundaries for the use of new technologies by
                    governments as instruments of control for the state.<br>

                    At the same time that policymakers are under scrutiny both for their decisions about how to regulate
                    technology as well as their decisions about how and when to adopt technologies like facial
                    recognition themselves, technology firms and designers have also come under increasing criticism.
                    Growing recognition that the design of technologies can have far-reaching social and political
                    implications means that there is more pressure on technologists to take into consideration the
                    consequences of their decisions early on in the design process (Vincenti 1993; Winner 1980). The
                    question of how technologists should incorporate these social dimensions into their design and
                    development processes is an old one, and debate on these issues dates back to the 1970s, but it
                    remains an urgent and often overlooked part of the puzzle because so many of the supposedly
                    systematic mechanisms for assessing the impacts of new technologies in both the private and public
                    sectors are primarily bureaucratic, symbolic processes rather than carrying any real weight or
                    influence.<br>
